In terms of specific technologies driving this surge in expenditure would be artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), accounting for a whopping 48% of the whole pie. The survey also highlights the relative immaturity of AI technologies compared to the other innovation areas. Just over half of respondents report significant target customer adoption of their AI-enabled products and services. 41% of respondents cited AI emerging technologies as still being in development or early adoption stages, meaning there is a wave of potential adoption as new or augmented AI products and services enter general availability. Technology immaturity is cited as a top reason among AI-investing organizations leading to failure when integrating an emerging technology. Furthermore, product leaders investing in AI whose implementations are progressing slower than expected reported product complexity and a lack of skills as the main hindrances to their progress. There are a couple of industry AI/ML models built on top of AWS SageMaker as the supplement of AWS managed AI/ML services. Those AI/ML models are scattered, lack of web visualization, and not ready to present to customer directly, especially for the customers\u2019 business staff. The customers may not aware of the existing matured AI/ML models which can solve their complex business problems. It will be nice to allow the customers to get aware of the matured AI/ML models existing in AWS for specific industry AI/ML scenarios and experience the AI/ML models in an intuitive way and adopt directly or after customization. Target customers The customers can be defined as business related (business owner and business operation) and IT related (data scientist and application developer). Business owner is more focused on the business impact in general and usually it is the decision-maker. Business operation is more focused on daily business operation and usually it is the end-user of the business operation system. Data scientist is more focused on the creation, fine-tuning and performance measurement of the AI/ML model which will be used in the business operation system. Application developer is more focused on the engineering implementation of the business operation system. To be simplified, term \u201cBusiness\u201d will represent the business owner and business operation in short and term \u201cIT\u201d will represent the data scientist and application developer in short. Solution overview This solution includes AI/ML models suitable for specific business scenarios, such as object detection, image classification, text recognition, object extraction/generation, text summarization, intent recognition, knowledge graph, time series prediction, etc. which can be commonly used in manufacturing, maintenance, enterprise security production, content production, document recognition, comment recognition, short video content understanding and generation, personalized recommendation, advertisement placement, sales forecast, etc. This solution includes the basic functions of data labelling, model training, deployment and inference in the cloud and device terminals commonly used in the AI/ML process, enabling the entire process to achieve low threshold, full functionality, visualization, and customization. Customer can also complete the entire AI/ML process through a graphical interface to solve business problems in specific business scenarios even they don\u2019t have in-depth knowledge on AI/ML. This solution can further export AI/ML models for these specific business scenarios, providing complete source code, demo web sites, and automated deployment methods that enterprise customers can use directly or further customize. Help enterprise customers accelerate the entire AI/ML implementation process, and promote enterprises to transfer more business loads to AWS. Features Multiple industrial models and visualized demonstrations supported Multiple industrial models are already supported, including track maintenance, PPE detection, image classification, image search, document recognition, receipt recognition, generic object detection, customer sentiment analysis, summary generation, text labeling, entity and relationship extraction from documents, etc., Demonstrate real-time inference or run batch inference tasks in an intuitive way Multiple machine learning algorithms supported A variety of machine learning algorithms have been supported, including object detection, image classification, OCR/table recognition, text summarization, text classification, named entity/relationship recognition, fine-grained sentiment analysis, etc. You can use your own based on the supported algorithms Data on demand to customize industrial models. Complete machine learning process supported Supports multiple machine learning tasks such as labeling, training, cloud/edge deployment, real-time reasoning, batch reasoning, pipeline, etc., provides comprehensive API support to facilitate customized development, provides various sample codes, and provides deployment scripts to realize automatic deployment in global regions. Architecture Algorithms There are 3 kinds of AI/ML algorithms supported in All-In-One AI: computer vision algorithms for object detection, image classification, search by image, OCR, etc. Yolov5
